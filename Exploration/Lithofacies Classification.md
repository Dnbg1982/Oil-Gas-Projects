# Lithofacies Classification Competition Kaggle
Facies characterization in the rock is significant for exploration phase and estimation of reservoir production. Specialists spend hundreds of hours examining rock properties in order to label different layers. An incorrect classification could cost millions and project failure. Hence, machine learning model could colaborate petroleum professionals determining the facies faster and more accurate.

GOAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Making Lithofacies Classification Model Using ML Algorithms

DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Datasets was taken from FORCE 2020 Competition organized by Canadian Well Logging Society CWLS 

EVALUATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evaluation will be done with a penalty matrix given by the competition. Given the dataset is not balanced we could use F1-score or Recall to evaluate model performance.
