# Seismic Inversion Using XGBoost
Seismic inversion converts original reflectivity data, as typically recorded routinely, from an interface property to a rock property known as impedance, which itself is the multiplication of sonic velocity and bulk density. Most oil and gas companies now use seismic inversion to increase the resolution and reliability of the data and to improve estimation of rock properties including porosity and net pay.

## Problem
Using well logs seismic inversion was perform in order to make a better estimation of rock attributes.

## Data
Data used in this project came from open data (3D Poseidon from Australia). Seismic acquisition in 2009 by ConoPhilips Data given:
