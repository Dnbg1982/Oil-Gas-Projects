# Salt Detection Using Neural Networks
Salt bodies bounce sound waves erratically becoming one of the main issues in seismic surveys. Characterization of this bodies is extremely difficult due to complex shapes and unpredicted changes in impedance and velocity. Hence, to indentify salt bodies accurately and faster I made a machine learning model based on deep learning.
