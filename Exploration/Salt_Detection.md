# Salt Detection Using Neural Networks
Salt bodies bounce sound waves erratically becoming one of the main issues in seismic surveys. Characterization of this bodies is extremely difficult due to complex shapes and unpredicted changes in impedance and velocity. Therefore, to help geologists identify salt bodies more accurately, I built a machine learning model based on deep learning.

GOAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Differentiate the part of subsurface which is salt.

DATA
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The set of images was gotten from Kaggle Salt Detection Competition. Images were chosen at various locations in random subsurface spots.
