# Oil Production Forecasting Using XGBoost Competition By Kaggle
Appraisal phase could be one of the most important stage in oil industry. Since, here is where feasibility of a project based on field's oil production. To determine how many barrels reservoir engineers use a formula to estimate decay curve of production. However,  could machine learning approach do abbeter job?

GOAL

Predict the first three years cum of a producing well starting from peak of production.
